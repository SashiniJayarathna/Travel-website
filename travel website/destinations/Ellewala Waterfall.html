            <p>Ellewala waterfall is a beatific small waterfall popular for its eco-liveliness and peaceful-countryside atmosphere hidden inside the territory of the Ella jungle. It’s not exactly similar to Ella falls, but, many people still manage to visit Ellewala falls to enjoy a bath, diving, or splash time in a natural pool in the midst of the jungle. It is also called chasing waterfall.</p>
            <p>It’s about 4 meters’ height waterfall that is are accessible from Ella – Wellawaya road, at least five kilometers inside woods from Wellawaya town. When you are coming from Wellawaya, 3 km along the Ella road to reach an ancient temple, Rathmal Vehera. The opposite road from the temple directly leads to the falls.</p>
            <p>If you are expecting to stay a couple of days in Ella, Ellewala falls an awesome place you should never miss. Except on the rainy days, it’s a well enjoyable, safe natural pool you can have some relaxation in your busy schedule.
