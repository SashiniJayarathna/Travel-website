            <p>It is the second-highest waterfall in Sri Lanka which is 220m (720 feet) high located near Koslanda. If you reach the top of the Diyaluma falls (Upper Diyaluma) then you will be able to go for a swim in the natural pools. Keep an eye on the rising water levels during the rainy season in this area.</p>
            <p>Yes, you are right you came here to read about the second-highest waterfall in the island of Sri Lanka. Diyaluma is one of the best iconic waterfalls in the country which is located in Koslanda that belongs to the Badulla District. The meaning of Diyaluma stands for the rapid flow of water downstream. The waterfall is 220m (720 feet) high and it laster turned in to Punagala Oya which is a branch of the Kuda Oya that then joins the Kirinndi Oya.</p>
            <p>If you are planning to start your journey from Colombo then the best thing you can do is to Jump on the Badulla Night Mail Train which will start at 8.15 PM from Colombo and the Trail will reach Haputale by 6.30 am in the morning. There are plenty of Coffee sellers for you to warm you up in the cold weather conditions on your journey to Haputale.</p>
            <p>So, the journey begins from Haputale on a bus to Wellawaya and you will have to get down at Koslanda Junction. Next, hire a tuk-tuk to the Diyaluma falls. Or you can simply hire a rent a car for the whole journey. The best part is that you can ask the tuk-tuk drivers to take you to watch the elephants who come to drink water from the upper deck of the Diyaluma falls.</p>
            <p>Tuk-tuk drivers will drop you at the Poonagala estate where you will have to go through a trek. The estate is famous for its rubber and the breath-taking view is one of a kind. And you will surely enjoy the journey to the falls even though you find some rocky places on the way. Once you continue the journey for about 45 minutes you will reach the Upper Diyaluma.</p>
            <p>You can find some natural water basins on top of the Upper Deck of Diyaluma falls but keep an eye on the rising water levels during the rainy season.</p>
