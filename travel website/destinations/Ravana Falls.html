            <p>It is another iconic waterfall in Badulla which is 82 feet in height. It is one of the best 3 tire waterfalls in Sri Lanka. We would not recommend you to hike up the rocky waterfall but why not have a dip in the basin right below the Ravana Falls.</p>
            <p>Among the most Iconic places in the Badulla District Ravana falls is another place where you could enjoy the natural beauty in Sri Lanka. It’s not far away if you are planning to Visit Ella Rock or the Little Adams Peak. So, without wasting your time just jump on a bus or a Tuk Tuk and get directions to the Ravana falls.</p>

            <p>The Ravana Waterfall was named in memory of King Ravana who was once the most technologically advanced king based on historical Information. King Ravana hid Princess Sita in the Ravana Caves right Behind the Waterfall. This is based on prehistoric information and the Ramayana Story. It is believed that Princess Sita bathed in the Ravana Waterfall which was covered with thick dense forest back in the days.</p>
            <p>Even though there are no warning signs you should not climb over the slippery surfaces. Yes, you can go for a dip in the basin right below the Ravana Falls. However, it might be dangerous to climb over the rocks. If you visit during a rainy season then you can easily see the waterfall flow in the shape of an Areca flower. But during the dry season the water flow will reduce dramatically.</p>
            <p>This place is said to be one of the best for nature photography. Plus, you can find enough locals around the place if you are interested in knowing a bit more about the surroundings. The water in the Ravana Falls is crystal clear and they come from natural springs.</p>
